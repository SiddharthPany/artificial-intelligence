### Solution1

- Vanila network just to figure out what architecture works fine and can we reach the required accuracy. Accuracy achived is **99.13**

### Solution2

- Added **BatchNormalization** this increased the accuracy to **99.20**

### Solution3

- Added **DropOuts**  this increased the accuracy to **99.37**

### Solution4

- Added **LearningRateScheduler** to change learning rate as no of epochs changes this increases the accuracy to **99.48.**
